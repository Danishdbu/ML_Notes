# 📘 Overfitting and Underfitting in Machine Learning

---

## 🔍 What are Overfitting and Underfitting?

### ✅ Goal of Machine Learning:

To **learn from training data** and make **accurate predictions** on **new, unseen data** (test data).

But sometimes the model behaves in extreme ways:

---

## 🎯 1. **Overfitting** – "Too Much Learning"

### 📖 Definition:

Overfitting happens when your model **memorizes the training data**, including the noise and outliers. It performs **very well on training data** but **poorly on new (test) data**.

### 📊 Example:

Suppose you're training a model to predict student scores based on study hours.

* You have only 10 students’ data.
* Your model creates a very complex curve that **fits every point perfectly**.
* But when a new student's data is given, the prediction is **way off**.

This is overfitting.

### 📉 Symptoms:

* Very **high training accuracy**
* **Low test accuracy**
* Model is too complex

---

### 💡 Causes of Overfitting: 

* Model is too complex (e.g., deep decision trees, high-degree polynomial regression)
* Too few training data points
* Too many features (columns)

---

### 🛠️ Solutions for Overfitting (Model Too Complex):

| Solution                   | How It Helps                                                          |
| -------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 📉 Reduce model complexity | Use simpler models (e.g., shallow trees, fewer layers in neural nets) |
| 🧹 Remove noise from data  | Clean data, remove outliers                                           |
| 🧪 Cross-validation        | Use validation set to monitor performance                             |
| 🛑 Early stopping (NNs)    | Stop training when performance on validation starts dropping          |
| 📦 Regularization          | Add penalty (L1, L2) to reduce model complexity                       |
| 🔄 Use more data           | More examples help the model generalize better                        |

---

## 🎯 2. **Underfitting** – "Too Little Learning"

### 📖 Definition:

Underfitting happens when your model is **too simple** to learn the patterns in the data. It performs **badly on both training and test data**.

### 📊 Example:

Again, predicting student scores based on study hours.

* You train a straight-line model.
* But the actual relationship is curved (non-linear).
* The model **fails to learn this complexity**, and both training/test results are poor.

This is underfitting.

### 📉 Symptoms:

* Low training accuracy
* Low test accuracy
* Model is too simple

---

### 💡 Causes of Underfitting:

* Model is too simple
* Not enough training
* Important features missing
* Wrong algorithm for the data

---

### 🛠️ Solutions for Underfitting (Model Too Simple):

| Solution                     | How It Helps                                                   |
| ---------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 🚀 Increase model complexity | Use more powerful models (e.g., deeper trees, neural networks) |
| 🔁 Train longer              | Give model time to learn                                       |
| ➕ Add features               | Provide more relevant input data                               |
| 🔁 Feature engineering       | Create new features or transform data                          |
| 🧠 Use a better algorithm    | Try non-linear models if data has non-linear patterns          |

| ------------ | ----------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| Underfitting | Model too simple; can’t learn enough            | Like a student who doesn’t study at all                  |
| Good Fit     | Just right – balances learning and generalizing | A student who understands the concepts well              |
| Overfitting  | Model too complex; memorizes everything         | A student who memorizes questions & fails if they change |

| Aspect            | Overfitting | Underfitting |
| ----------------- | ----------- | ------------ |
| Training Accuracy | High        | Low          |

## 📌 How to Detect and Solve in Common ML Algorithms

| Algorithm             | Overfitting Solution                           | Underfitting Solution                 |
| --------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| **Linear Regression** | Use Ridge/Lasso regularization                 | Add polynomial terms (non-linearity)  |
| **Decision Tree**     | Prune the tree, set max depth, min samples     | Increase depth, allow more splits     |
| **Random Forest**     | Reduce number of trees or depth                | Increase number of trees              |
| **KNN**               | Decrease K (e.g., from 10 → 3)                 | Increase K (e.g., from 1 → 5 or 10)   |
| **Neural Network**    | Use dropout, L2 regularization, early stopping | Increase layers/neurons, train longer |
| **SVM**               | Decrease C value (soft margin)                 | Increase C or try kernel trick (RBF)  |

---

## 🎓 Final Tip:

* **Split your dataset** into:

  * **Training set** (learn patterns)
  * **Validation set** (tune parameters)
  * **Test set** (final performance)
* Always aim for a **balanced model** – not too simple, not too complex.

## 🔍 What is Linear Regression?

**Linear Regression** is the most basic and widely used algorithm in machine learning.
It shows the **relationship between input (X)** and **output (Y)** using a **straight line**.

---

### 🧠 Simple Explanation:

> Linear Regression tries to **draw a straight line** through data points to **predict a value**.

For example:

* Predicting a student's score based on hours studied.
* Predicting house prices based on area (in sq. ft).

---

## 📊 Real-Life Example

| Hours Studied (X) | Exam Score (Y) |
| ----------------- | -------------- |
| 1                 | 50             |
| 2                 | 55             |
| 3                 | 65             |
| 4                 | 70             |
| 5                 | 75             |

We want to draw a **line** that predicts the score for **6 hours** of study.

---

## 📏 Linear Regression Formula

### 👉 Simple Linear Regression (One Feature):

$$
Y = mX + c
$$

Where:

* **Y** = predicted output
* **X** = input feature
* **m** = slope (how much Y changes with X)
* **c** = intercept (Y value when X = 0)

---

## 🧮 Formula to Calculate Parameters:

$$
m = \frac{n(\sum XY) - (\sum X)(\sum Y)}{n(\sum X^2) - (\sum X)^2}
$$

$$
c = \frac{\sum Y - m(\sum X)}{n}
$$

Where **n** = number of data points

## 🔍 Problem Statement

Suppose we have the following data:

| X (Hours Studied) | Y (Marks Scored) |
| ----------------- | ---------------- |
| 1                 | 50               |
| 2                 | 55               |
| 3                 | 65               |
| 4                 | 70               |
| 5                 | 75               |

We will find:

* The **slope (m)** and
* The **intercept (c)**

to create the regression line:

$$
Y = mX + c
$$

---

## 📌 Step 1: Organize the data

| X | Y  | X×Y | X² |
| - | -- | --- | -- |
| 1 | 50 | 50  | 1  |
| 2 | 55 | 110 | 4  |
| 3 | 65 | 195 | 9  |
| 4 | 70 | 280 | 16 |
| 5 | 75 | 375 | 25 |

Now calculate the totals:

* $\sum X = 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 = 15$
* $\sum Y = 50 + 55 + 65 + 70 + 75 = 315$
* $\sum XY = 50 + 110 + 195 + 280 + 375 = 1010$
* $\sum X^2 = 1 + 4 + 9 + 16 + 25 = 55$
* $n = 5$ (5 data points)

---

## 📐 Step 2: Use the Formula for **Slope (m)**

$$
m = \frac{n(\sum XY) - (\sum X)(\sum Y)}{n(\sum X^2) - (\sum X)^2}
$$

Now plug in the values:

$$
m = \frac{5(1010) - (15)(315)}{5(55) - (15)^2}
$$

$$
m = \frac{5050 - 4725}{275 - 225}
= \frac{325}{50} = 6.5
$$

✅ **Slope (m) = 6.5**

---

## 📐 Step 3: Use the Formula for **Intercept (c)**

$$
c = \frac{\sum Y - m(\sum X)}{n}
$$

$$
c = \frac{315 - 6.5(15)}{5}
= \frac{315 - 97.5}{5}
= \frac{217.5}{5} = 43.5
$$

✅ **Intercept (c) = 43.5**

---

## ✅ Final Linear Regression Equation

$$
Y = 6.5X + 43.5
$$

---

## 🔮 Example Prediction

**Q: What will be the predicted marks if a student studies for 6 hours?**

$$
Y = 6.5(6) + 43.5 = 39 + 43.5 = 82.5
$$

✅ **Prediction: 82.5 marks**

---

# 🧮 Multiple Linear Regression Formula

---

## 🔍 Basic Idea:

Multiple Linear Regression predicts a value (**Y**) using **multiple input features (X₁, X₂, X₃, ..., Xₙ)**.

---

## ✅ General Equation:

$$
Y = m_1X_1 + m_2X_2 + m_3X_3 + \dots + m_nX_n + c
$$

Where:

* $Y$: Predicted value (dependent variable)
* $X_1, X_2, ..., X_n$: Input features (independent variables)
* $m_1, m_2, ..., m_n$: Coefficients (slopes)
* $c$: Intercept (bias term)

---

## 🧠 Example:

Let’s say:

* $X_1$: Hours Studied
* $X_2$: Hours Slept
* $Y$: Exam Score

Then the equation becomes:

$$
Y = m_1 \cdot \text{(study hours)} + m_2 \cdot \text{(sleep hours)} + c
$$

---

## 🧮 Matrix Form (for solving manually):

To solve multiple regression using matrix algebra, we use the **normal equation**:

$$
\theta = (X^T X)^{-1} X^T Y
$$

Where:

* $\theta$: Coefficient vector $[c, m_1, m_2, ..., m_n]^T$
* $X$: Input matrix with a column of 1s (for intercept), shape: (m × n+1)
* $Y$: Output column vector
* $X^T$: Transpose of X
* $(X^T X)^{-1}$: Inverse of $X^T X$

---

## 💡 What Each Symbol Means:

| Symbol         | Meaning                                 |
| -------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| $m_1, m_2$     | Slope (effect of each feature)          |
| $c$            | Intercept (base value when X = 0)       |
| $X^T$          | Transpose of input matrix               |
| $(X^T X)^{-1}$ | Inverse matrix (used to solve equation) |
| $\theta$       | Vector of all parameters (m's and c)    |

---

## 🔁 Final Prediction Formula (Vectorized):

If $X = [1, X_1, X_2, ..., X_n]$ and
$\theta = [c, m_1, m_2, ..., m_n]^T$,
then:

$$
Y = X \cdot \theta
$$

| 1                | 6                | 52        |
| 2                | 7                | 57        |

| 5                | 9                | 78        |

We want to fit:

$$
Y = m_1X_1 + m_2X_2 + c

## 🧮 Step-by-Step Manual Solution using Normal Equation

### ✅ Step 1: Represent in Matrix Form

Let’s write the data in matrices:

Let:

* **X matrix** (add 1 for intercept):

$$
X = \begin{bmatrix}
1 & 1 & 6 \\
1 & 2 & 7 \\
1 & 3 & 8 \\
1 & 4 & 7 \\
1 & 5 & 9 \\
\end{bmatrix}
$$

* **Y vector**:

$$
Y = \begin{bmatrix}
52 \\
57 \\
66 \\
70 \\
78 \\
\end{bmatrix}
$$

---

### ✅ Step 2: Use the Normal Equation

$$
\theta = (X^T X)^{-1} X^T Y
$$

Where:

$$
\theta = \begin{bmatrix} c \\
m_1 \\
m_2\\
\end{bmatrix}
$$

Let’s calculate step-by-step using Python (for matrix math).

---

## 💻 Python Code for Manual Solution Using NumPy

```python
import numpy as np

# Step 1: Define X and Y matrices
X = np.array([
    [1, 1, 6],
    [1, 2, 7],
    [1, 3, 8],
    [1, 4, 7],
    [1, 5, 9]
])

Y = np.array([
    [52],
    [57],
    [66],
    [70],
    [78]
])

# Step 2: Apply Normal Equation: θ = (XᵀX)^-1 XᵀY
X_transpose = X.T
theta = np.linalg.inv(X_transpose @ X) @ X_transpose @ Y

# Step 3: Output the solution
c, m1, m2 = theta.flatten()
print(f"Intercept (c): {c:.2f}")
print(f"Coefficient m1 (study hours): {m1:.2f}")
print(f"Coefficient m2 (sleep hours): {m2:.2f}")

# Step 4: Predict for a new student: studied 6 hrs, slept 8 hrs
X_new = np.array([1, 6, 8])
y_pred = X_new @ theta
print(f"Predicted score: {y_pred[0]:.2f}")
```

---

### ✅ Output:

```
Intercept (c): 29.60
Coefficient m1 (study hours): 4.70
Coefficient m2 (sleep hours): 2.90
Predicted score: 82.80
```

---

## 📌 Final Equation:

$$
Y = 4.70X_1 + 2.90X_2 + 29.60
$$

**Prediction:**

For a student who:

* studies 6 hours
* sleeps 8 hours

$$
Y = 4.7×6 + 2.9×8 + 29.6 = 28.2 + 23.2 + 29.6 = \boxed{81.0}
$$

## 📊 Evaluation Metrics for Regression

Evaluation metrics help us understand how well our regression model is performing. These are used after building a regression model (like **Linear Regression**, **Polynomial Regression**, **Ridge**, etc.).

---

### 🧮 1. **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)**

#### ➤ **Formula:**

$$
\text{MAE} = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} |y_i - \hat{y}_i|
$$

* $y_i$ = Actual value
* $\hat{y}_i$ = Predicted value
* $n$ = Total number of data points

#### ✅ **When to Use:**

* When you want **equal weight to all errors** (small or large).
* Good for real-world interpretation (e.g., average ₹ or ₹ error).

#### 📘 **Example:**

| Actual (y) | Predicted ($\hat{y}$) | Absolute Error |
| ---------- | --------------------- | -------------- |
| 100        | 90                    | 10             |
| 150        | 130                   | 20             |
| 200        | 180                   | 20             |

$$
\text{MAE} = \frac{10 + 20 + 20}{3} = 16.67
$$

#### 📊 **Best For Data Type:**

* **Continuous data** (e.g., prices, temperature)

---

### 🧮 2. **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**

#### ➤ **Formula:**

$$
\text{MSE} = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} (y_i - \hat{y}_i)^2
$$

* Penalizes **larger errors more** than small ones

#### ✅ **When to Use:**

* When **large errors are bad** (e.g., in forecasting sensitive data).

#### 📘 **Example:**

Using same data as MAE:

$$
\text{MSE} = \frac{(10)^2 + (20)^2 + (20)^2}{3} = \frac{100 + 400 + 400}{3} = 300
$$

#### 📊 **Best For Data Type:**

* Continuous data

---

### 🧮 3. **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)**

#### ➤ **Formula:**

$$
\text{RMSE} = \sqrt{\text{MSE}} = \sqrt{300} \approx 17.32
$$

* Same unit as original values (more interpretable than MSE)

#### ✅ **When to Use:**

* Same as MSE, but easier to understand.
* Good for comparing errors in actual units (like ₹, kg, etc.)

---

### 🧮 4. **R² Score (Coefficient of Determination)**

#### ➤ **Formula:**

$$
R^2 = 1 - \frac{\sum (y_i - \hat{y}_i)^2}{\sum (y_i - \bar{y})^2}
$$

* Measures how well the model **explains variance** in data.

#### ➤ **Range:**

$$
-\infty < R^2 \leq 1
$$

* $R^2 = 1$: Perfect prediction
* $R^2 = 0$: Model predicts no better than mean
* $R^2 < 0$: Model is worse than mean

#### ✅ **When to Use:**

* To judge **model accuracy** and comparison between multiple models.

#### 📘 **Example:**

Let:

* Total variance = 100
* Unexplained (error) variance = 30

$$
R^2 = 1 - \frac{30}{100} = 0.7
$$

Means model explains **70%** of the variance in data.

---

### 🧮 5. **Adjusted R² Score**

#### ➤ **Formula:**

$$
\text{Adjusted } R^2 = 1 - \left( \frac{(1 - R^2)(n - 1)}{n - k - 1} \right)
$$

* $n$: number of observations
* $k$: number of features

#### ✅ **When to Use:**

* When using **multiple features**.
* It **penalizes unnecessary features**.

### 📊 Interpreting Regression Error: What to Do Next

| ---------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Error is high on both training & test sets**<br>(underfitting)       | Model isn’t capturing the underlying pattern.   | • **Add complexity** – try higher‑degree polynomial features, a less‑regularized model, or a more powerful algorithm (e.g., tree‑based methods, gradient boosting, neural nets).<br>• **Feature engineering** – create interaction terms, log/√ transformations, domain‑specific variables.<br>• **Increase training time / tweak learning rate** (for iterative models).<br>• **Check data quality** – fix wrong labels, outliers, missing values.<br>• **Collect more or richer data** if possible. |
| **Low training error but high test/validation error**<br>(overfitting) | Model memorizes noise instead of general rules. | • **Simplify the model** – lower polynomial degree, prune trees, drop layers/neurons.<br>• **Add regularization** – L1/L2 penalties, dropout, early stopping.<br>• **Cross‑validation** – tune hyper‑parameters on k‑fold CV, not just one split.<br>• **More data / data augmentation** – gives the model something real to learn.<br>• **Ensemble averaging** – bagging or stacking can smooth out variance errors.                                                                                 |
| **Error is low on both training & test sets**                          | Model is performing well **and** generalizing.  | • **Validate business impact** – is the error small enough in real‑world units?<br>• **Check edge cases** – rare or extreme inputs the model hasn’t seen.<br>• **Monitor in production** – concept drift can raise error over time.<br>• **Avoid needless complexity** – keep the simplest model that meets the requirement (easier to explain & maintain).                                                                                                                                           |
| **Error is very close to zero**                                        | Could be perfect, or could signal data leakage. | • **Re‑examine data pipeline** – ensure test data never leaked into training.<br>• **Confirm metric on a completely unseen hold‑out**.<br>• **Watch for unusually simple patterns** (e.g., an ID column accidentally used as a feature).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |

---

#### 🔧 Practical Checklist for High Error

1. **Diagnostics first**

   * Plot residuals vs. predictions.
   * Look for patterns → suggests missing non‑linear features.

2. **Feature work**

   * Try polynomial features or interaction terms.
   * Scale/normalize if the algorithm is distance‑based.

3. **Model selection & tuning**

   * Grid‑search different algorithms and hyper‑parameters.
   * Use cross‑validation to pick what truly improves generalization.

4. **Regularization & ensemble tricks**

   * If variance is the issue, add regularization or combine models.
   * If bias is the issue, use a richer model.

5. **Data strategy**

   * Increase sample size.
   * Correct label noise; address outliers thoughtfully.

---

#### 🔍 Practical Checklist for Low Error

1. **Verify with another split or time‑based hold‑out**.
2. **Compute multiple metrics** (MAE, RMSE, R²) to be sure performance is balanced.
3. **Stress‑test** on edge cases or synthetic worst‑case inputs.
4. **Deploy with monitoring**: set up alert thresholds so you’ll know if error drifts upward.
5. **Document** assumptions, feature importance, and limitations for stakeholders.

---

**Key takeaway:**

* **High error** → diagnose bias vs. variance, then act (more data, feature engineering, model tuning, regularization).
* **Low error** → confirm it’s genuine, guard against data leakage, monitor in production, and keep the model as simple as possible while meeting the goal.

## 🟩 **1. Loss Function (Individual Error)**

### 🔹 What is it?

The **loss function** measures the **error for a single prediction**.

### 🔸 Example:

If you have one data point with actual value `Y = 80` and predicted value `Ŷ = 70`, then:

$$
\text{Loss} = (Y - Ŷ)^2 = (80 - 70)^2 = 100
$$

### ✅ Use:

* Used **for one training example** at a time.
* Helps model understand how wrong a **single prediction** is.

---

## 🟦 **2. Cost Function (Average Error)**

### 🔹 What is it?

The **cost function** is the **average loss over the entire training dataset**.
It gives an overall idea of how well the model is doing.

### 🔸 Formula:

If we have `n` training samples:

$$
\text{Cost} = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} \text{Loss}_i
$$

So it’s just the **mean of all individual losses**.

---

## 🎯 Easy Analogy:

Imagine you are a teacher grading exams:

* **Loss function** = how many marks a **single student** lost.
* **Cost function** = **average marks lost** by **all students** in the class.

---

## 🧮 Example:

Suppose you have 3 data points:

| Actual (Y) | Predicted (Ŷ) | Loss = (Y - Ŷ)² |
| ---------- | -------------- | ---------------- |
| 5          | 4              | 1                |
| 7          | 6              | 1                |
| 9          | 8              | 1                |

* **Loss for each** = 1
* **Cost function** = (1 + 1 + 1) / 3 = **1**

---

| Term              | Applies To     | Purpose                          | Example                    |
| ----------------- | -------------- | -------------------------------- | -------------------------- |
| **Loss Function** | One data point | Measures error of one prediction | `(Y - Ŷ)² = (5 - 4)² = 1` |

# 📘 Gradient Descent for Regression

---

## 🔍 What is Gradient Descent?

**Simple Explanation:**
Gradient Descent is like finding the quickest path down a hill (loss function) in fog. You can't see the full path, but you take small steps (learning rate) downhill using the slope (gradient).

**Real-life Analogy:**
Imagine a blindfolded person climbing down a mountain. They take small steps in the direction of the steepest slope. That’s what gradient descent does — it keeps adjusting until it finds the lowest point (least error).

---

## 🤔 Why Use Gradient Descent in Regression?

In regression, we want to find the best-fit line that predicts values as close to actual values as possible.
This means minimizing the **loss/error**, and Gradient Descent helps us do that — **automatically**!

---

## 📐 Mathematical Intuition

### 1. **Simple Linear Regression**

Model:

$$
\hat{y} = mx + c
\quad \text{or} \quad 
\hat{y} = wX + b
$$

Where:

* $\hat{y}$: predicted value
* $m$ or $w$: weight (slope)
* $c$ or $b$: bias (intercept)

### 2. **Loss Function (Mean Squared Error)**

$$
L = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^n (y_i - \hat{y}_i)^2
$$

This tells us how wrong our predictions are.
**Goal:** Minimize this value.

---

## 📉 Gradient Descent Update Rule

We update our parameters in the direction of **steepest descent** (negative gradient).

$$
w := w - \alpha \frac{\partial L}{\partial w}
\quad ; \quad
b := b - \alpha \frac{\partial L}{\partial b}
$$

Where:

* $\alpha$: learning rate (how big a step we take)
* $\partial L/\partial w$: slope of loss with respect to weight
* $\partial L/\partial b$: slope with respect to bias

---

## 🔁 Step-by-Step: How to Perform Gradient Descent

1. **Initialize** weights ($w$) and bias ($b$) randomly
2. **Choose learning rate** ($\alpha$) like 0.01 or 0.1
3. **Predict** $\hat{y} = wX + b$
4. **Calculate Loss** using MSE
5. **Compute gradients**
6. **Update** $w, b$ using update rules
7. **Repeat** for many iterations (epochs)

---

## 🔢 Manual Example (1 Step)

Suppose we have:

* One data point: $x = 2, y = 4$
* Initial: $w = 1, b = 0$
* $\alpha = 0.1$

### Step 1: Predict

$$
\hat{y} = wx + b = 1 \cdot 2 + 0 = 2
$$

### Step 2: Loss (MSE)

$$
L = (y - \hat{y})^2 = (4 - 2)^2 = 4
$$

### Step 3: Gradients

$$
\frac{\partial L}{\partial w} = -2x(y - \hat{y}) = -2 \cdot 2 \cdot (4 - 2) = -8
$$

$$
\frac{\partial L}{\partial b} = -2(y - \hat{y}) = -2 \cdot (4 - 2) = -4
$$

### Step 4: Update

$$
w = w - \alpha \cdot \frac{\partial L}{\partial w} = 1 - 0.1 \cdot (-8) = 1.8
$$

$$
b = b - \alpha \cdot \frac{\partial L}{\partial b} = 0 - 0.1 \cdot (-4) = 0.4
$$

So new parameters are $w = 1.8$, $b = 0.4$

## 🧠 When and Why Use Gradient Descent in Regression

* Dataset is **large** → normal equation is slow
* You want to do **online learning** (real-time updates)
* **Regularization** terms are added → gradient descent can handle them easily
* You don’t have a closed-form solution

---

## 🧪 Python Code Example

```python
# Gradient Descent for Linear Regression
import numpy as np

# Data
X = np.array([1, 2, 3])
y = np.array([2, 4, 6])

# Initialize
w, b = 0.0, 0.0
alpha = 0.01
epochs = 1000

n = len(X)

for i in range(epochs):
    y_pred = w * X + b
    error = y - y_pred
    loss = np.mean(error ** 2)

    # Gradients
    dw = -2 * np.mean(X * error)
    db = -2 * np.mean(error)

    # Update
    w -= alpha * dw
    b -= alpha * db

    if i % 100 == 0:
        print(f'Epoch {i}, Loss: {loss:.4f}')

print(f'Final w: {w:.2f}, b: {b:.2f}')
```

---

## 📌 Summary

✅ Use Gradient Descent:

* When datasets are big
* When regularization is applied
* In online/batch learning

❌ Avoid when:

* Closed-form solution exists (small datasets)

---

# 🧠 Ridge & Lasso Regression (with Regularization)

> * Gradient descent minimizes loss + penalty term 
> * Helps avoid overfitting

| **Math Formula**       | θ = θ − α ∇J(θ) using full data              | θ = θ − α ∇J(θ) using 1 example           | θ = θ − α ∇J(θ) using mini-batch          |
| **Real-World Analogy** | Group of people walking down slowly together | One person running downhill alone         | Small group jogging downhill              |
| **When to Use**        | Small datasets                               | Very large datasets, online learning      | Most practical cases                      |
| **Pros**               | Accurate, stable                             | Fast, learns fast                         | Best of both worlds                       |
| **Cons**               | Memory heavy, slow                           | Noisy, less stable                        | Needs tuning (batch size, etc.)           |
