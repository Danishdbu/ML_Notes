# Logistic Regression: Logit Function Explanation

## Logistic Regression Equation

The logistic regression model is defined using the **logit function**:

\[
\log\left(\frac{p(X)}{1 - p(X)}\right) = \beta_0 + \beta_1 X
\]

---

## What this equation means

This equation models the relationship between an input variable \( X \) and the probability of a binary outcome.

### Term-by-term explanation

- **\( p(X) \)**  
  The predicted probability that the outcome is **positive** (class = 1) given input \( X \).

- **\( 1 - p(X) \)**  
  The probability that the outcome is **negative** (class = 0).

- **\( \frac{p(X)}{1 - p(X)} \)**  
  The **odds** of the positive outcome occurring.

- **\( \log\left(\frac{p(X)}{1 - p(X)}\right) \)**  
  The **log-odds (logit)**.  
  This transforms probabilities (between 0 and 1) into values ranging from \(-\infty\) to \(+\infty\).

- **\( \beta_0 \)**  
  The **intercept (bias)** term.  
  It represents the log-odds when \( X = 0 \).

- **\( \beta_1 \)**  
  The **coefficient (weight)** for the predictor \( X \).  
  It indicates how much the log-odds change when \( X \) increases by one unit.

- **\( X \)**  
  The input feature (independent variable).

## Why the logit function is used

- Linear regression can predict values outside the range \([0, 1]\), which is invalid for probabilities.
- The logit function allows logistic regression to:
  - Model a **linear relationship** between inputs and log-odds
  - Convert that linear output into a **valid probability** using the sigmoid function

---

## Inverse of the logit (Sigmoid function)

Applying the inverse of the logit gives the probability:

\[
p(X) = \frac{1}{1 + e^{-(\beta_0 + \beta_1 X)}}
\]

This ensures:
- Output is always between **0 and 1**
- The model can be used for **binary classification**

---

## Summary

- Logistic regression performs **linear regression on log-odds**
- The logit function connects probabilities to a linear model
- The sigmoid function converts log-odds back into probabilities
- Classification decisions are made by applying a threshold (e.g., 0.5)
